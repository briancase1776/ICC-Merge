description: >-
  Merge icc-pipes pipes. Copy what one side writes into any of several
  pipes onto the same lanes of one pipe, byte for byte, in order per
  inlet, until removed. Plain bytes and icc-frames payloads alike come
  out of the outlet as they went in, one inlet at a time. What the bytes
  are, which inlet is talking, and why they are merged, is the caller's
  business.

# icc-merge

A merge is N inlet pipes and one outlet pipe. Every byte SIDE writes into
a lane of any inlet comes out of the same lane of the outlet, in the
order it went in on that inlet. It is a fitting: it joins pipes that
icc-pipes already made and makes nothing else. Pipes says what a lane is
and which lanes each side writes; see its SKILL.md.

    /tmp/icc-merge-XXXXXXXX/merge  DST, SIDE, then each SRC, one per line
    /tmp/icc-merge-XXXXXXXX/pid    one copier per lane SIDE writes per SRC,
                                   lane order, then SRC order within a lane

## Operations

    scripts/create DST SIDE SRC...  copy what SIDE writes into every SRC
                                    onto DST, print the merge's directory.
                                    Every pipe must exist and have the
                                    same lane count.
    scripts/list                    one line per merge: DIR up|down DST SIDE SRC...
    scripts/remove DIR              stop the merge, delete DIR. The pipes on
                                    either end are left as they were.

SIDE is 0 or 1, as Pipes says: side 0 writes the even lanes, side 1 the
odd ones. To use a merge, write an inlet as SIDE and read the outlet as
the other side. There is nothing else to do.

    a=$(.../icc-pipes/scripts/create 6); b=$(.../icc-pipes/scripts/create 6)
    c=$(.../icc-pipes/scripts/create 6)
    m=$(scripts/create "$c" 0 "$a" "$b")
    .../icc-frames/scripts/write "$a" 0 < photo.jpg
    timeout 5 .../icc-frames/scripts/read "$c" 1 > photo.jpg

## Facts about the merge

Each lane SIDE writes, of each SRC, has its own `cat(1)`, that lane of
that SRC as its file and that lane of DST as its stdout. These are
properties of that and of the lanes. The skill adds nothing to them.

- A merge copies one direction of each inlet. The lanes the other side
  writes are not touched. Nothing goes back through it; the way back
  from the outlet to the inlets would be a tee, not this.
- The merge is the reader of every lane it copies. Bytes it takes are
  gone from that inlet and exist only on the outlet. Read the outlet.
- Every inlet lane is copied whole, in order, onto the same lane number
  of the outlet, and every pipe has the same lane count. That is all
  icc-frames' rule needs, so a Frames write into one inlet while the
  others are quiet is a Frames read on the outlet.
- The merge is one more writer on each outlet lane per inlet. Everything
  Pipes says of a writer holds for each. Between inlets nothing holds:
  a copier writes whatever one read of its inlet lane returned, and
  where that falls against another inlet's is not promised. Nothing on
  the outlet says which inlet a byte came from. Two inlets writing the
  same lane at once is two writers on one lane, as Pipes says.
- Each chunk read from an inlet lane is written to the outlet lane
  before the next chunk is read. An outlet lane that is full and not
  being drained stalls every copier writing to it, so that lane of every
  inlet stalls behind it once it fills. Nothing is kept.
- What a write into an inlet can leave on the wire and walk away from is
  that inlet's lanes plus, while its copiers can move, the outlet's
  lanes, which every inlet shares. Pipes' SKILL.md has the numbers.
- A copier ends when its inlet lane hits EOF or a write to the outlet
  lane fails. Held lanes never do either, so the merge runs until removed
  or until a pipe on either end is removed. Then list says down. remove
  it and create it again.
- The inlet lane is in each copier's argv; the outlet lane is not.
  `pkill -f` on a SRC path finds that inlet's copiers. On the DST path
  it finds nothing.

## In Claude Code

Every Bash call is a fresh shell. The copiers are their own processes,
so the merge outlives calls. Seats in one session share the container
and its /tmp; sessions do not, so no merge crosses that line.
