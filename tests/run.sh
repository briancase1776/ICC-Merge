# Prove the merge: get three pipes, merge side 0 of two into the third, push a
# Frames payload bigger than one lane holds through each inlet in turn, read it
# back whole from the outlet each time, then plain bytes on one lane from both
# inlets, take the lock and see nobody else can, remove it. The pipes stay up.
